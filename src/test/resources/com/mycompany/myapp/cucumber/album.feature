      | event        | Family Summer Trip      |
      | creationDate | 2024-01-15T10:00:00.000Z |
    Then the album should be created successfully
    And the album should have name "Summer Vacation 2024"
    And the album should be associated with event "Family Summer Trip"
    And the album should belong to the current user
